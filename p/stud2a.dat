0 //Do note parts using this still need to (optionally) add the hole part of the stud.
0 // This is not done here because in most parts it will extend beyond the stud.
0 // Also sometimes the stud is actually part of a longer M-cyl, in such cases you should drop this one using the id and redo the whole shape.
